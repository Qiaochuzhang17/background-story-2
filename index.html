	<center><p>The Nine Songs is a set of eleven poems from the anthology The Songs of Chu, which is traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan (about 343â€“278 B.C.).</p><center>

	 <center><p>The poetry, which may represent ancient shamanistic dramas, consists of lyrics meant to be performed. 

	 </p><center>By the time Wang Chong transcribed The Nine Songs in the sixteenth century, the words and content of the poems could still be read and spoken,</p><center>

	 	</p><center> but the accompanying sounds and actions had long been forgotten.</p><center>
